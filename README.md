# TODO, progressively-enhanced

I'm intrigued by the idea of a ToDo App being a server-driven app. What does a server-side version of the ToDo App look like? What does a progressively-enhanced version of _that_ look like? How difficult is it build?

## Development & install

This project uses:

- Node.js (v15.8+)
- NPM
- Express (For routing, CRUD API, and server-side views)
- Nunjucks (Server-side templating)

### Installing a development environment

```bash
npm i
```

### Starting the development server

```bash
npm start
```

Then open a browser to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
